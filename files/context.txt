Feature Overview: User Onboarding, Authentication, and Analytics Visualization
This document outlines the consolidated design and implementation plan for three core functionalities being introduced into our application: user registration, login UI redesign, and data visualization for sales performance. Together, these stories aim to enhance the user onboarding experience, improve usability and design consistency, and provide meaningful analytical insights for business intelligence. This initiative is part of our broader strategy to streamline the SDLC process and automate story generation and tracking in JIRA through AI integration.

üîê 1. User Registration API
A secure and reliable user registration mechanism forms the bedrock of our authentication infrastructure. This component focuses on providing new users with a straightforward yet secure method of creating an account in the system.

The REST API endpoint for registration will:

Accept a JSON payload containing user credentials and optionally profile fields.

Validate all inputs for format, uniqueness (e.g., duplicate email), and completeness.

Hash passwords securely using modern algorithms like bcrypt with salting and proper iterations.

Store the data in a MongoDB collection, ensuring schema compliance and future scalability.

Return meaningful success or error messages, following REST standards and HTTP status codes.

The endpoint will also include edge case handling such as rate limiting to prevent abuse, and extensibility for features like email verification, CAPTCHA, or multi-factor authentication.
